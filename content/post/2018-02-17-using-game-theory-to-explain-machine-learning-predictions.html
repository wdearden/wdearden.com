<p><em>In this post, I explain the Shapley value from cooperative machine learning and how it can be used to explain machine learning predictions.</em></p>

<h2>The Shapley Value</h2>
<p>Let’s say you and your friends Mimi, Colter, and Lance <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> are splitting an Uber. You live closest to the origin. Mimi and Colter live together just a few blocks farther and Lance lives the farthest away. Lance suggests that Uber has a handy built-in <a href="https://help.uber.com/h/2ccba301-152e-4747-b207-e4281a1a2ba5">fare splitter</a> which will split the fare evenly between all of you</p>
